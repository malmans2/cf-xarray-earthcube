    "## The 10 rules\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations are based on [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tell a story for an audience: interleave explanatory text with code and\n",
    "   results to create a computational narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document the process, not just the results: so that others, and yourself\n",
    "   later, will understand your reasoning and choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use cell divisions to make steps clear: have eaach cell perform one\n",
    "   meaningful and documented step, avoid long cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularize code: use and document functions for repeated operations to make\n",
    "   the code more readable and save space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Record dependencies: use pip or Conda package manager, with environment.yml\n",
    "   (Conda) or requirements.txt (pip). Please indicate package versions\n",
    "   explicitly. Ideally, include a listing of dependencies at the bottom of the\n",
    "   notebook. Make sure you test your notebook in an environment created from\n",
    "   these dependencies, so that you don't add undocumened dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use version control: https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime is a diffing tool\n",
    "   specifically designed for notebooks; you may find it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Build a pipeline: place key variable declarations at the top. Test with\n",
    "   different parameters, clean up, and run all cells to prepare for potential\n",
    "   non-interactive execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Share and explain your data: if the original data are too big, inlude a\n",
    "   sample. Make sure that the data is accessible. Include data description, and\n",
    "   any processing done beforehand. Ideally, point to datasets that have been\n",
    "   permanently managed and identified by DOIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored:  \n",
    "   9.1. Read: store it in a public code repository with a clear README file and\n",
    "   a liberal open source license. Generate HTML/PDF versions of the final\n",
    "   notebook.  \n",
    "   9.2. Run: use Binder to run it in the cloud, and/or create a Docker image.  \n",
    "   9.3. Explore: use interactive widgets (e.g., ipywidgets, or panel)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Advocate for open research: ask your colleagues or friends to try to run\n",
    "    your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional recommendations, beyond the 10 rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do not include shell commands in cells (unless the notebook will be\n",
    "   distributed in Docker container.)\n",
    "2. Keep cell output if other researchers will use the included data, or clear\n",
    "   cell output if they will use their own data.\n",
    "3. Develop your code in a clean virtual environment, to avoid dependency\n",
    "   conflicts and streamline packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n <enviroment_name> python=3 jupyter -y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then activate it. See more about creating virtual environments in [9], [10].\n",
